## Link to Debug logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your Wire logs, and link them here.
It is recommended to directly contact our [customer support](mailto:support@wire.com) and send the debug report by email, because it can potentially contain some private information, that you don't want to share to the public.

## How to send detailed debug report from Wire:

1. Go to Settings -> About
2. Tap "Wire swiss GmbH" 10 times
3. Reproduce your issue
4. Send the report from Settings -> Advanced -> Submit debug report
5. Go to Settings -> About
6. Tap "Wire swiss GmbH" 10 times again to disable detailed debug reports, because this slows down Wire
